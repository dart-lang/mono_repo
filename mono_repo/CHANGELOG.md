## 2.5.0-dev

* `mono_repo.yaml`:
  * Respect the ordering of `stages`, if configured.
  * Allow `stages` values to be just a string – allows defining an explicit
    ordering of stages. 

## 2.4.0

- Adds a `--validate` option to the `travis` command.
  - You can configure this to run from any of your `mono_pkg.yaml` files using
    a command job like this:
    
    `command: "cd ../ && pub global run mono_repo travis --validate"`.
  - We may make this easier to configure in the future.
- Require Dart SDK `>=2.7.0 <3.0.0`.

## 2.3.0

- Add support for `os` configuration.
  - This generally works in the same way as the `dart` sdk option, except
    that it is not required.
  - The default is to only run on `linux`.
  - Supports a top level `os` list in `mono_pkg.yaml` files.
  - Supports overriding the `os` per task.

## 2.2.0

- Fix issue where `pub` command failing for one package stops test run for
  other packages grouped into the same Travis task.
- Use `flutter packages` for `pub` command on packages that depend on Flutter.
- Any arguments given to `dartfmt` Travis tasks are used instead of the default 
  `-n --set-exit-if-changed .`.
  - To maintain previous behavior, `dartfmt: sdk` is a special case and still
    triggers the default arguments.
- Add `--use-get` optional flag for the `travis` command to use `pub get` 
  instead of `pub upgrade` in the generated script.

## 2.1.0

- Require Dart SDK `>=2.2.0 <3.0.0`.

`mono_repo travis`
- Job entries in `.travis.yml` are now ordered. This may cause churn, but will
  create a predictable output going forward. 
- While running, print the package when starting each task.
  Makes it easy to scan results when a job has multiple packages.
- Warns if a job specifies a target Dart SDK that is not supported in the
  corresponding `pubspec.yaml`.

`mono_repo pub`
- Added support for all `pub` flags.

## 2.0.0

* *BREAKING* All commands are recursive by default. To go back to the shallow
  mode, use `--no-recursive`.
* Improve style of the generated `tool/travis.sh` script, including fast-failing
  if the `PKG` variable does not map to an existing directory.
* Require at least Dart 2.1.0.
* The `dart` key is no longer required in `mono_pkg.yaml` if all stages specify
  their own values. A warning is printed if values are provided but not used.
* All output during execution will be sent to STDOUT (instead of STDERR).

## 1.2.2

* Updated dependencies.

## 1.2.1

* Fix issue running with Dart 2.0.

## 1.2.0

* Add `--version` to executable.
* Include the version of the package in generated files.
* Support customizing Travis-CI `branches` in `mono_repo.yaml`.

## 1.1.0

* Improve presubmit command output to list the full command for each task
  instead of the name of the task type only.

## 1.0.0

* Add support for configuring top-level Travis options via `mono_repo.yaml`.

**BREAKING CHANGES**

* The root `mono_config.yaml` file is no longer used to configure which packages
  are configured. Instead, `mono_pkg.yaml` is required to be in each target
  package directory. A package is considered published if it has a value for
  `version` in `pubspec.yaml`.

* The package configuration file is now `mono_pkg.yaml`. If a legacy config file
  – `.mono_repo.yml` – is found, the command is canceled and a warning is
  printed telling the user to rename the file.

* Removed the `init` command.

## 0.3.3

* Support adding custom cache directories in each project.
* Add custom names for travis jobs based on the actual tasks being ran, as well
  as the sdk and subdirectory. The job description portion is configurable with
  the new `description` key for jobs within a stage, for example:

```yaml
stages:
  - unit_test:
    - description: "chrome"
      test: -p chrome
```

## 0.3.2+1

* Support Dart 2 stable.

## 0.3.2

* Support dependencies that specify an SDK – common with Flutter.
* Require at least Dart 2.0.0-dev.54.
* `pub` command now runs with inherited standard IO. You now see colors!
* Improved error output with bad configuration.

## 0.3.1

### New Features

* Added support for the `group` task, which accepts a list of tasks using the
  normal format. This can be used to group multiple tasks in a single travis
  job. All tasks will be ran, but if any of them fail then the whole job will
  fail.

  Example usage combining the analyzer/dartfmt tasks:

```yaml
stages:
  - analyze_and_format:
    - group:
        - dartanalyzer
        - dartfmt
```

## 0.3.0

### Breaking Changes

* Sub-package `.travis.yml` files should be replaced with `.mono_repo.yml`
  files, which are a simplified format that supports travis build stages. A
  basic example file might look like this:

```yaml
# List of the sdk versions you support
dart:
  - dev
  - stable

# Ordered list of all stages you want to run.
stages:
  # A single stage, called `analyze_and_format` which runs the analyzer and
  # the formatter only.
  - analyze_and_format:
    - dartanalyzer: --hints-as-warnings .
    - dartfmt: sdk
      dart:
        - dev # Overrides the top level sdk default
  # Assuming everything analyzed correctly, runs a build.
  - build:
    - command: "pub run build_runner build"
  # And finally run tests, these are custom build_runner tests but the regular
  # `test` task is also supported.
  - unit_test:
    - command: "pub run build_runner test"
    - command: "pub run build_runner test -- -p chrome"
```

## 0.2.2

* `travis` command

  * Make numbering more consistent and clean when there is more than one task
    with a given name.

  * Print out the full command that executed as part of a task.

  * Support a `List` value for `before_script`.

## 0.2.1

* `travis` command

  * Write ANSI escape sequences in `tool/travis.sh` as pre-escaped ASCII
    literals.

  * Added `--[no-]pretty-ansi` flag to allow ANSI sequences to be optionally
    omitted.

## 0.2.0

* Add `before_script` support to the `travis` command. When that value is set in
  a `travis.yml` file, we will call the script before running any of the tasks
  for that package.

* Add `recursive` global flag. When set, we will walk all sub-directories
  looking for `pubspec.yaml` files.

* Support git dependencies in packages.

* Use `mono_repo.yaml` as the configuration file name, instead of
  `packages.yaml`.

## 0.1.0

* Initial release.
